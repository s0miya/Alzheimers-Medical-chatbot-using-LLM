# Alzheimers-Medical-chatbot-using-LLM

This project involves the development of a medical chatbot designed to assist individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers. The chatbot utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) based on GPT-2 to provide information, answer questions, and offer support related to Alzheimer's. The goal is to create a responsive and informative assistant that can help manage the daily challenges faced by those affected by Alzheimer's.

# Key Features
1. Data Preparation:
	  - Collecting and preprocessing medical and conversational data relevant to Alzheimer's.
	  - Tokenizing and formatting text data for input into the LLM.

2. Model Setup:
	  - Using GPT-2 from Hugging Face's Transformers library.
	  - Fine-tuning the pre-trained GPT-2 model on the Alzheimer's-related dataset.
	  - Configuring the model for generating relevant and accurate responses.

3. Chatbot Development:
	  - Implementing the logic for interacting with users through a conversational interface.
	  - Handling user inputs and generating appropriate responses using the fine-tuned model.

4. Evaluation and Improvement:
	  - Evaluating the chatbot's performance using evaluation metrics.
	  - Iteratively improving the model based on feedback and performance metrics.
